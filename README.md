## 2.Install the Dapper NuGet package.
## 3.Configure the database connection in the project's configuration file.
## 4.Create a model class that represents the data you'll be working with.
## 5.reate a class that will serve as the database context and handle the connection to the database.
## 6.Implement CRUD operations using Dapper's query methods.
## 7.Create API endpoints (controller actions) that call the appropriate methods in the database context class.
## 8.Test your API using tools like Postman or curl.
